        <p id="barriersMainPoint">The biggest barrier is people. We need society to understand how significant emergency transport, especially ambulances, is. Currently funding goes into.<br> generative ai and artificial general intelligence research.<br> These ais however, provide a bad name for overall ai, and constitute a negative effect on society. Actual ai that helps everyday tasks, that ai was supposed to be made for in the first place, is underfunded and forgotten about. Including, emergency transport routing systems which is a narrow ai. If this continuous in free generative and artificial general intelligence still occurs, with the continued lack of knowledge and understanding in ai systems that actually help, emergency transportation routing systems will continue to be ignored.</p>
