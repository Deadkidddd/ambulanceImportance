        <p id="barriersMainPoint">The biggest barrier is people. We need society to understand how significant emergency transport, especially ambulances, is. With funding going into new ai research, ai that is actually helpful to society is brushed aside. Its not just about giving more funds to routing system research but the fact that what we as society constitute as "important research" is flawed. Instead pf investing in ai in the intent to replace the working people, we, as a society need to clarify our needs, and this includes emergency transport.</p>
        <p id="barriersMainPoint">So even if you've never had the experience of dealing with an ambulance, think about this, the government is investing in replacing the people instead of helping the people, and we should be holding them accountable. Not everything should be captilism, and the bare minimum that we should expect is reseach that will actually help us as a society.</p>
