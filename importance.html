        <p id="importanceMainPoint">As stated in the beginning, ambulances provide transportation to those who need it, but whats' not as well known is the routing systems used are older models that don't get nearly enough research attention as other sectors of the economy.<br>90% of traffic facilities occur in middle-low income rural areas while the estimated arrival time of ambulances in the country side has been reported to sometimes be up to 45 minutes(Luan & Jiang).<br> Information from other organizations and older studies conducted shows that driving styles itself can influence arrival time. Yet lack of funding declines the possibility for looking into intergrating these variables in routing systems. So old models are still used making the arrival time for emergency transport actually slower comparitevely with how fast other sectors have gotten.</p>
